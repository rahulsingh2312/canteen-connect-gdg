## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#F27405) to represent energy, warmth, and appetite.
- Background color: Desaturated orange (#F7D1B3). Provides a comforting backdrop that is not too intense.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#F2A905). An analogous color, brighter and more saturated, for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings to give a geometric, contemporary look, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text for readability.
- Use simple, food-related icons in a filled style to match the playful, modern aesthetic. The icons should use the primary color.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the menu and dashboard, ensuring a clean and organized presentation of information. The app will utilize a card-based layout for menu items.
- Incorporate subtle animations such as fading transitions and scaling effects when items are added to the order or when the order status changes, providing gentle feedback to the user.
